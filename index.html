    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Integral Education began not as a business, but as a student’s quiet obsession with learning. From the start, he understood that education isn’t just about what you learn — it’s about how you learn. To him, tutoring was never a simple exchange of information. It was a craft shaped by reflection, intention, and social connection. It meant letting results speak, not for ego, but for refinement. In that process, education became an art.</p>
    <p>What began with one tutor and a handful of students has grown into a network that spans across Melbourne’s South East. Today, we are a community of tutors and learners from all walks of life, united by a shared belief in the value of deep, thoughtful learning.</p>
    <p>Starting with mathematics, we’ve since expanded our offerings to cover a wide range of subjects — from Year 7 to VCE and beyond. Whether it’s Bosnian, Global Politics, English, or Physics, our goal remains the same: to provide an education that serves not only the student, but the society they help shape.</p>
